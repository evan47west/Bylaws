All Active Brothers and Associate Members who live on campus shall participate in the Chapter Meal Plan.

  3. The Assistant Treasurer must present the semesterly fees and budget for the Meal Plan, to be approved by the EC, at the ECM before the second to last GFM of the preceding Active term. The fees and budget may be approved in accordance with Article 10 Section 2 Subsection 4 and 5.

### Section 7.
The Treasurer shall be directly responsible for all financial matters regarding the Chapter budget and House budget, and shall oversee the Assistant Treasurer in matters regarding the Meal Plan budget. The Treasurer shall:
  1. Keep accounts for all Brothers, Associate Members, and any other person who shall be responsible for making payments to the house.  He will be responsible to bill for all dues, fees, room, and other financial obligations that such individuals may incur and owe.  Bills must be issued to each individual who owes the Chapter money within the first 2 weeks of a given semester during the Active Chapter Period, and are due ten (10) days after being issued.  Money paid by an individual to the Fraternity shall pay for the following items in the order listed:
    1. Money will go toward paying off the amount(s) remaining on any defaulted P-Note(s).
    2. Money will go toward paying off the amount(s) remaining on any current P-Note(s).
    3. Money will go towards paying off all current debts and/or fees.
  2. Credit all accounts as necessary. Credits shall be given upon prior approval for receipts turned in no later than ten (10) days after the purchase. Anyone without a receipt or challenging a credit amount shall bring the issue before the Judicial Board.
  3. Keep the checkbook under lock and key. Checks will be written only by the Treasurer or President and signed only by the eligible officers (President, VP of Member Education and Treasurer). Any member of the chapter found guilty of an attempt to improperly access the checkbook or sign a check shall be immediately brought up on charges of un-brotherly conduct and possible expulsion.
  4. Be responsible for reporting the financial status of the chapter at regular fraternity meetings (ECM and GFM) in the following manner:
    1. A list of current AR (with names)
    2. Outstanding bills that the fraternity owes.
    3. Announce at each ECM, the specific budgets remaining for every office that maintains a budget throughout the year.

### Section 8.
All active Associate Members and initiated Brothers of the Fraternity must sign the Inter-fraternity Council’s standard payment statement form as well as the Fraternity’s Financial Obligation form. This shall be done within thirty (30) days of becoming involved with the fraternity. No P-Notes shall be granted to individuals who have not signed and submitted both forms.

### Section 9.
The Treasurer may, upon his discretion and investigation, approve a P-Note as specified within these By-Laws. If bills (payable to any of the fraternity accounts) are unpaid, delinquent individuals owing more than $100 shall be required to sign a P-Note. Delinquent individuals may sign a P-Note at any time before, but no later than the second week of each semester. Any delinquent individual, who does not sign a P-Note before the second week of the semester, shall be brought before the Judicial Board by the Treasurer. An acceptable P-Note is one that is payable by the first day of the last month in the term. However, the Judicial Board may, upon its discretion and investigation, approve an Extended P-Note as specified within these By-Laws. Anyone who misses any payment on their P-Note will have 10% yearly compounded interest assessed on the amount of the missed payments. The names of members who missed a payment shall be reported by the Treasurer of the Chapter at the next GFM. The Treasurer and or the Judicial Board may only alter a P-Note upon written agreement.

Additionally, for extreme cases of delinquency, without an Extended P-Note, the following consequences will be applied two weeks before the end of each semester, including summer:

  - Anyone owing more than $2500 to the fraternity will not be allowed to live in the chapter house after the end of the semester.
  - Anyone owing more than $4000 to the fraternity will have expulsion charges brought against them by the Treasurer at the next GFM.

### Section 10.
The Judicial Board upon the detailed review of a Brother's financial status may decide to grant the signing of an Extended P-Note which shall compound the moneys owed to the chapter for those terms which a Brother is financially unable to pay the Fraternity but wishes to remain a part of the Chapter. An acceptable Extended P-Note is one that is payable within six months after graduation with a minimum payment of fifty ($50) per month and a two percent (2%) interest rate compounded monthly from the time of issuance of the Extended P-Note, should any payment be defaulted. The Judicial Board may only alter an Extended P-Note upon written agreement.

This privilege may be refused/revoked upon the following conditions:

  - The Brother petitioning for extended payment of dues cannot demonstrate a true need for this privilege. Any Brother who has been granted reduced dues at any time has no guarantee that the privilege will be extended.
  - A Brother who has already been granted an extended payment arrangement demonstrates that he has not presented all financial information available to the Judicial Board by participating in other activities which are not required by school or their employer(s) but which do require a financial source. Any Brother found to be guilty of this shall be immediately asked for his resignation (with the contractual obligation still due).

### Section 11.
The House Manager shall announce at a regular meeting of the Chapter and post on the bulletin board the availability of room applications for the following term. This shall be done by the eighth week of the term. Mailed notices shall be sent the seventh week of the term to all Brothers not in school but who are expected to be in school the following term. Applications for Fall Semester house residency shall be opened by the eighth week of Spring Semester. Room assignments shall be made by the House Manager according to the preferences of the Brothers submitted to him in writing. All applications for house rooms shall be due no later than two weeks after the opening date. The Judicial Board according to the following priority system shall resolve conflicts.

  1. The Brother’s outstanding debts to the House, including the Kitchen account, shall not exceed $100.00. Under special circumstances, this section may be overturned by a unanimous decision of the Judicial Board if a satisfactory plan of payment has been agreed upon by means of a P-Note. While the plan of payment is in effect, if payment is missed the Brother or Associate Member will have no priority for the term after which said payment was missed.
  2. The president shall have priority on room 1 however; Article 14, Section 11, Subsection 3, “Any Brother who is financially responsible for a space in the Chapter house shall have priority in the room continuously” does not apply to room 1 should the next elected president choose not to replace the previous president in room 1.
  3. Any Brother who is financially responsible for a space in the Chapter house shall have priority in the room continuously for a maximum of 6 active (Fall or Spring) semesters. This procedure will stand unless the Brother’s cumulative grade point average is below a 3.0, and both of the Brother’s past two full-time academic semesters resulted in a grade point average below 2.6, as determined by an annual grade analysis of all brothers on January 1st of every calendar year. At this point, or at the expiration of the 6 allotted semesters in the Chapter house, or 10 Fall or Spring semesters enrolled at Georgia Tech, the brother will lose squatting privileges and be moved to the bottom of the priority list for the duration of the next individual housing signup period.
    1. Following the loss of squatting privileges, a brother may regain the priority points that he previously accumulated by earning a minimum 2.6 grade point average for one semester in which the brother completes a minimum of 6 credit hours in the summer or 12 credit hours in fall or spring semesters.
    2. If the brother affected by a loss of housing priority as specified in Article 14, Section 11, Subsection 3 feels that he is an exception; he may then appeal his case to the E.C.
  4. Second priority to move into the house shall be given to all elected officers.  Next priority shall be the total number of terms one has been financially responsible to the Fraternity for a space in the Chapter house, except for a Brother who has been dropped from the school roll because of unsatisfactory scholarship, or who has been inactive for more than two school terms of Active Chapter period shall have House priority below that of the least senior Brother at the time of re-admission or at the time the Brother becomes active. This procedure will stand unless a brother seeking to initially move into the house has less than a 2.6 cumulative grade point average at the time of housing signups, in which case said brother will be moved to the bottom of the priority list.
    1. For every summer term one has been financially responsible for a space in the Chapter house, additional priority equal to one-half (1/2) Spring or Fall term’s priority shall be awarded to that Brother’s total number of terms.
    2. For every semester during the active chapter period, all elected officers shall receive additional priority equal to one-half (1/2) Spring or Fall term’s priority in addition to their priority gained from living in the house.
    3. For every semester one assumes the role of house dishwasher, additional priority equal to one-half (1/2) Spring or Fall term’s priority shall be awarded to that Brother’s total number of terms.
    4. For every semester one is selected to join a committee officially sanctioned by the Inter-fraternity Council, additional priority equal to one-half (1/2) Spring or Fall term’s priority shall be awarded to that Brother’s total number of terms.
  5. Roll book number shall resolve any conflict not resolved by the previous methods. All brothers who expect to be ineligible to live in the House shall present their cases to the Judicial Board before the House room application deadline. Boarders located by the House Manager shall fill all room assignments not filled.
  6. All persons renting a room from the Chapter must sign the housing contract provided by the House Manager. All persons that agree to the housing contract are financially responsible for the Fall and Spring semester’s total rent and housing fees. Appeals will be heard by the E.C.
    1. No person graduating in a Fall semester may live in the Chapter house for that semester. No person may sublet a room in the Chapter house to a Brother, nor may they sublet a room if there are any Brothers or Associate members who desire to live in the Chapter House, with the exception of the following section (1). This By-Law may not be suspended but may be amended.
      1. Once during the time in which a person is a Brother of the fraternity, they may sublet the room they are currently financially responsible for to another Brother or Associate Member to retain the housing priority contained in Article 14, Section 11, Subsection 3 of these By-Laws (“Squatter’s Rights”).  However, the Sublettee will gain all other privileges of being financially responsible for a room in the Chapter House as outlined in Article 14, Section 11. Additionally, that space must be sublet to the Brother with the highest priority desiring to live in that space
      2. Provided that no additional Brothers or Associate members desire to live in the Chapter House during the summer term, the subletting of any room may be considered pre-approved by the Chapter for that term.
      3. The House Manager reserves the right to deny the subletting of any room.  This may be overturned by a simple majority vote of the Chapter or J-Board.
      4. If a Brother wishes to gain priority for subletting a room, they will not receive any monetary compensation for finding a person to fill their space in the Chapter House.
      5. No Brother may sublet more than one room, nor may they occupy the Chapter House as well as sublet a room in it.
      6. Priority for subletting of rooms is as follows:
        1. All Brothers signing contracts to live in the house themselves will have first priority determined by Article 14, Section 11 of these By-Laws.
        2. Second priority will be given to Brothers wishing to sublet rooms. Any disputes will be settled by the same priority system outlined in Article 14, Section 11 of these By-Laws.
    7. Any person intending to sublet their room must notify the House Manager no less than five (5) days prior to the close of housing sign ups. The House Manager will then assign their priority according to the prior (f.)  Brothers may not sublet rooms after this period unless approved by the House Manager and their priority is reassigned according to the prior (f.). Additionally, the Brother intending to sublet is responsible for payment of rent and housing deposit at the time of signature of contract and all collections from the subletee. That Brother is also responsible for any damage done to the house and any monetary compensation required by the fraternity for that damage.
